# 🧠 Agent Architect Skill

This skill enables the Agent to perform **Meta-Programming** on itself. It is used to design new Skills, refine Rules, and debug Workflows.

## Usage

Trigger via: `/architect`

## Capabilities

### 1. System Audit
- Scan `.agent/` directory for structure violations.
- Check consistency between Rules and Procedures.

### 2. Skill Generation
- Create boilerplate for new Skills (`SKILL.md`, `rules/*.md`).
- Define rigorous Procedures based on user requirements.

### 3. Rule Hardening
- Analyze Rules for "Loophole" (Ambiguity).
- Refine wording to be "Contractual" (Must/Shall).

## Procedures
- `procedures/new_skill_design.md`: Workflow for creating a new skill.
- `procedures/system_audit.md`: Checklist for verifying system integrity.
